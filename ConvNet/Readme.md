This repository contains the code for Efficient Federated Unlearning under Plausible Deniability with custom convolution network (ConvNet) which consists of two convolution layers 
(first layer with 20 filters, second layer with 10 filters with (3, 3) as kernel size) and a dense layer (32 neurons) as hidden layer.
